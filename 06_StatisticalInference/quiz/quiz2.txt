Question 6
The respiratory disturbance index (RDI), a measure of sleep disturbance, for a specific population has a mean of 15 (sleep events per hour) and a standard deviation of 10. They are not normally distributed. Give your best estimate of the probability that a sample mean RDI of 100 people is between 14 and 16 events per hour?

Question Explanation

The standard error of the mean is 10/100‾‾‾‾√=1. Thus between 14 and 16 is with one standard deviation of the mean of the distribution of the sample mean. Thus it should be about 68%.
