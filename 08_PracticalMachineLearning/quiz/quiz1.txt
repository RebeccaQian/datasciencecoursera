Question 2
Suppose we build a prediction algorithm on a data set and it is 100% accurate on that data set. Why might the algorithm not work well if we collect a new data set?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
We are not asking a relevant question that can be answered with machine learning.			
Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, predicting both the signal and the noise.	Correct	3.00	
We have used neural networks which has notoriously bad performance.			
We have too few predictors to get good out of sample accuracy.

Question 5
Suppose that we have created a machine learning algorithm that predicts whether a link will be clicked with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. The rate the link is clicked is 1/1000 of visits to a website. If we predict the link will be clicked on a specific visit, what is the probability it will actually be clicked?
