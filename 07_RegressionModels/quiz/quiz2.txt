Question 1
Consider the following data with x as the predictor and y as as the outcome.

x <- c(0.61, 0.93, 0.83, 0.35, 0.54, 0.16, 0.91, 0.62, 0.62)
y <- c(0.67, 0.84, 0.6, 0.18, 0.85, 0.47, 1.1, 0.65, 0.36)
Give a P-value for the two sided hypothesis test of whether β1 from a linear regression model is 0 or not.

Question 4
Refer to the previous question. Read the help file for mtcars. What is the weight coefficient interpreted as?

Your Answer		Score	Explanation
The estimated expected change in mpg per 1 lb increase in weight.			

The estimated expected change in mpg per 1,000 lb increase in weight.

Correct	1.00	
It can't be interpreted without further information			
The estimated 1,000 lb change in weight per 1 mpg increase.			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question Explanation

This is the standard interpretation of a regression coefficient. The expected change in the response per unit change in the predictor.
Question 5
Consider again the mtcars data set and a linear regression model with mpg as predicted by weight (1,000 lbs). A new car is coming weighing 3000 pounds. Construct a 95% prediction interval for its mpg. What is the upper endpoint?

Question 6
Consider again the mtcars data set and a linear regression model with mpg as predicted by weight (in 1,000 lbs). A “short” ton is defined as 2,000 lbs. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the expected change in mpg per 1 short ton increase in weight. Give the lower endpoint.

Question 7

Question 8
I have an outcome, Y, and a predictor, X and fit a linear regression model with Y=β0+β1X+ϵ to obtain β^0 and β^1. What would be the consequence to the subsequent slope and intercept if I were to refit the model with a new regressor, X+c for some constant, c?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
The new slope would be β^1+c			
The new intercept would be β^0+cβ^1			
The new slope would be cβ^1			
The new intercept would be β^0−cβ^1	Correct	1.00	
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question Explanation

This is exactly covered in the notes. But note that if Y=β0+β1X+ϵ then Y=β0−cβ1+β1(X+c)+ϵ so that the answer is that the intercept gets subtracted by cβ1
Question 9
Refer back to the mtcars data set with mpg as an outcome and weight (wt) as the predictor. About what is the ratio of the the sum of the squared errors, ∑ni=1(Yi−Y^i)2 when comparing a model with just an intercept (denominator) to the model with the intercept and slope (numerator)?

Question 10
Do the residuals always have to sum to 0 in linear regression?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
If an intercept is included, the residuals most likely won't sum to zero.			
The residuals never sum to zero.			
If an intercept is included, then they will sum to 0.	Correct	1.00	
The residuals must always sum to zero.

Question Explanation

They do provided an intercept is included. If not they most likely won't.
